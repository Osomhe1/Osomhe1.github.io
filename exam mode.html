    <h1>Project 3</h1>
    <p>This object contains both the entered text as well as a unique key value set by the current time (Date.now()). Now, if it isn't clear why we are specifying the key, that's OK. You'll totally see why in a few moments.
    
        Next, we are setting our state's items property with the following lines:</p>
    <p>Note that we are ensuring our state object isn't modified. We are instead giving it an entirely new array made up of both the existing items data along with the newly entered data.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we are clearing the value of our input element to make room for the next todo item. What may be less boring is this line here:</p>
    <p>We are overriding this event's default behavior. The reason has to do with how form submission works. By default, when you submit a form, the page reloads and clears everything out. We definitely don't want that. By calling preventDefault, we block the default behavior.</p>
    <p>It's time to take stock of where we are right now. If you preview your app and check the browser console, you'll see our state object correctly populating with each new todo item we added</p>
    <p>I realize all of this might not seem like much, but we are making great progress. Seriously!</p>
    <p>This might look like a lot of code to add in one giant swoop, but take a moment to look at what exactly you are adding. In our render function, we are taking the list of todo items</p>
